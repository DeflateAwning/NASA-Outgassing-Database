# NASA-Outgassing-Database
NASA's outgassing database/table, scraped and republished as a CSV

## Current State

The scraper broke between 2025-06 and 2025-08. The table, as of 2025-06-16, is available in the `output/` folder.

## Future Work

* Fix the scraper, using the new JSON Ajax endpoint.
* Add scheduled GitHub Action to publish the data on a schedule.
